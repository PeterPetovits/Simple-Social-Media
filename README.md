Simple Social Media using Server Client model in Java


This program was created as an assignment for the lesson "Computer Networks".
We had to made a simple social media (terminal, not ui) using the server-client model written in either java or python or c++. This program was written in Java.

So this program runs as a normal social media. The server runs on background and users can login in with their username and password. It checks if that user is registered and if they provided the correct credentials.
By following a simple menu, the user can choose different functions for example to upload an image, make a comment, like a picture, search for a user, send a friend request, see the followers/following and many more. 
The cool thing is that comments, pictures, profiles, uploads, pretty much everything is synced locally (on the user side) and also online (on the server side). So everyone can have access on the same information.

As part of the assignment and the content of the lesson we had also to implement some basic communication protocols over tcp java sockets. We implement (or at least we tried :) and managed to finish some of them) for example stop-and-wait, go-back-n and selective repeat.
